### Hides or reveals an element on scroll

Installation
------------
Place script inside of your jquery file or inside of a script tag


Detailed Explaination
-----------
**Works on touchpad, keyboard, page-up/down, and mouse wheel**

How does it work? 

* Determins the scroll direction of the user and compares it to the top of the page

* Add a slight timeout which should be the same as your CSS transition length to prevent the page from scrolling down while animation is taking place
